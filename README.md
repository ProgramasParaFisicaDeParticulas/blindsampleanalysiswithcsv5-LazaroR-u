Variable Description

Run The run number of the event.

Event The event number. E,px,py,pz For a lepton, either a muon or an electron, the total energy and components of the momemtum (in GeV).

pt The transverse momentum of the lepton (in units of GeV), either a muon or an electron.

eta The pseudorapidity of the lepton, either a muon or an electron.

phi The phi angle (in radians) of the lepton, either a muon or an electron.

Q The charge of the lepton, either a muon or an electron.

M The invariant mass (in GeV) of either two muons or two electrons.

chiSq The chi-squared per degree-of-freedom of the lepton, either a muon or an electron.

dxy The impact parameter in the transverse plane with respect to the vertex of the muon or electron.

iso The combined isolation (Itrack + Iecal + Ihcal) of the muon.

MET The missing transverse momentum of the event (in units of GeV).

phiMET The phi angle (in radians) of the missing transverse momentum.

type For an electron, either EB or EE: whether the electron is in the barrel or in the endcap.

type For a muon, either T or G: whether the muon is a tracker or global muon.

delEta The difference in eta (in radians) between the electron track and the associated cluster in the ECAL.

delPhi The difference in phi (in radians) between the electron track and the associated cluster in the ECAL.

sigmaEtaEta The weighted cluster rms along eta for an electron.

HoverE The energy of the electron in the HCAL divided by the energy of the electron in the ECAL.

isoTrack The isolation variable for the electron in the tracker.

isoEcal The isolation variable for the electron in the ECAL.

isoHcal The isolation variable for the electron in the HCAL.
